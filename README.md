# üéÆ CS213 Assignment 2: Board Game Collection

Welcome to the **CS213 Assignment 2** repository! This project demonstrates the power of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** through the development of a comprehensive board game application. It combines modularity, code reuse, and C++ Standard Template Library (STL) for creating and extending classic and innovative games.

---

## üìã Assignment Objectives
- **Learn and implement** OOP principles: inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Utilize STL and templates** for efficient code development.
- **Integrate recursion and backtracking** in game mechanics.
- **Demonstrate modular design** through a reusable game framework.
- **Collaborate using GitHub** and adhere to code quality standards.

## üïπÔ∏è Games Developed

1. **Pyramid Tic-Tac-Toe**  
   A unique version of Tic-Tac-Toe played on a pyramid-shaped grid.
   
2. **Four-in-a-Row**  
   A 2D adaptation of the classic Connect Four game.

3. **5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe**  
   An extended grid offering strategic depth to the classic game.

4. **Word Tic-Tac-Toe**  
   Form valid words instead of aligning Xs or Os!

5. **Numerical Tic-Tac-Toe**  
   Achieve a sum of 15 with three numbers in a row.

6. **Mis√®re Tic-Tac-Toe**  
   The goal is to avoid making three in a row!

7. **4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe**  
   A larger grid with more complex strategies and movements.

8. **Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe**  
   Win smaller boards to dominate the main board.

9. **SUS**  
   Create as many "S-U-S" sequences as possible on a 3x3 grid.
